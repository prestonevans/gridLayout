        <h1>Difference Between Access Point and Router</h1>
        <p class='span2'>The unbelievably rapid advancement of computer technologies has brought humanity a multitude of
            devices, appliances, and gadgets. In fact, there are so many different types and categories of computer
            equipment that it can be very easy for regular consumers to get confused by the subtleties of each device or
            gadget.
            One of the questions that our technical experts at LigoWave are frequently asked is what is the difference
            between an access point and a router. The fundamental differences between these two devices are quite
            simple, but there are other minor, yet still important, distinctions.</p>
        <p><strong>What is a Router?</strong> A router is a network device that serves two primary functions: (1) it
            connects multiple
            computers, phones, tablets, or other devices to form a managed local area network, and (2) it provides
            Internet access to all of the compatible devices that are connected to the router.
            A local area network (LAN) can be set up by simply deploying a router and connecting one or several devices
            to it. Modern routers allow users to connect devices both via Ethernet cables or wirelessly (using Wi-Fi).
            However, in order for the router to distribute and deliver data to the devices within the local area
            network, it must be connected to an Internet service provider’s customer premises equipment (CPE) via an
            Ethernet cable.</p>

        <p><strong>What is a Router?</strong> A router is a network device that serves two primary functions: (1) it
            connects multiple
            computers, phones, tablets, or other devices to form a managed local area network, and (2) it provides
            Internet access to all of the compatible devices that are connected to the router.

            to it. Modern routers allow users to connect devices both via Ethernet cables or wirelessly (using Wi-Fi).
            However, in order for the router to distribute and deliver data to the devices within the local area
            network, it must be connected to an Internet service provider’s customer premises equipment (CPE) via an
            Ethernet cable.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Functions.</strong> Other than providing a platform for various devices to communicate amongst
            each
            other, routers also have firewall and password protection functionality. This ensures that the connected
            wireless devices are protected against any threats that may arise from outside of the local area network.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Which is Better?</strong> The answer to the question which one is better? is that it depends on the
            needs. For homes and small business, routers may be the optimum (if not the best) solution, while medium to
            large enterprises and organizations will certainly require a network of access points and switches.</p>
        <p><strong>Main Differences.</strong> The router acts as a hub that sets up a local area network and manages all
            of the devices and communication in it. An access point, on the other hand, is a sub-device within the local
            area network that provides another location for devices to connect from and enables more devices to be on
            the network.Wireless routers can function as access points, but not all access points can work as routers.
            While routers
            manage local area networks, communicate with outside network systems, acquire, distribute, and dispatch data
            in multiple directions, establish a point of connectivity, and ensure security, access points typically only
            provide access to the router’s established network.</p>
        <p><strong>Access Points in Action.</strong> A few years ago, LigoWave devices were deployed by Enter Srl., a
            leading professional software solutions company and Internet services provider in Italy, for the purpose of
            setting up Internet access using access points at Festival ICT–B2B. The annual event brings in more than
            15,000 tech enthusiasts and professionals from Italy and abroad.
            It was estimated that more than 20,000 devices might need a steady and reliable Internet connection during
            the event. What is more, limited channel availability and RF-intense environments posed a challenge to
            setting up an effective network of access points that would be capable of providing a quality service to
            large amounts of people.</p>
        <p class='span2'>After careful planning, LigoWave provided 30 Infinity 2N access points for deployment in
            strategic locations. The network of access points covered an area of 2,400m² and provided Internet access to
            1,800–2,400 concurrent users, averaging at 60–80 users and 50–70Mbps throughput per access point. Despite
            the challenges, the average CPU load was low (20–30%).
            Careful and comprehensive planning helped to determine the best locations for access points, eliminating
            frequency overlap and reducing noise. Moreover, auto-channel, auto-transmit, and dual band capabilities have
            allowed for easy configuration, minimal maintenance, and increased connection capacity.</p>
        <p class='span2'>Since the event, the third generation of Infinity access points has been developed and
            introduced to the consumer market, so the possibilities are now even greater. The simple, yet powerful,
            Infinity line of products brings efficiency, reliability, and universality to the next level.

            documentation provided in the infinity series page.</p>
